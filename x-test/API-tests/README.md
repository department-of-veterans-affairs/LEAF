# LEAF API Testing

This test suite should exercise access rules, data accuracy, and measure performance within hotpaths for the LEAF API. ***Currently only compatible with Sprint-60-c2 and newer, due to recent containerization changes.***

This leverages an existing [LEAF docker development environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/LEAF/blob/master/docs/InstallationConfiguration.md), and temporarily uses a predefined test database.

TODO:
1. Need a more streamlined way to visualize results from benchmarks between different releases

## Prerequisites
- Install [LEAF docker development environment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/LEAF/blob/master/docs/InstallationConfiguration.md)
- The LEAF docker development environment must be running
  - If the test database's username/password in is different than tester/tester, update dbsetup_test.go

# Docker Environment

## Run
Navigate to the docker directory, then run:
```
docker compose up --remove-orphans
```


# Native Environment

## Prerequisites
- Install Go

## Run tests
```
go test
```

## Run benchmarks
```
go test -run="^$" -bench=. -count=3
```

## Benchmark analysis

Prerequisite:
```
go install golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat
```

Store results:
```
go test -run="^$" -bench=. -count=10 > sprint61.txt
```

Compare:
```
benchstat sprint60.txt sprint63.txt
```

Example output:
```
