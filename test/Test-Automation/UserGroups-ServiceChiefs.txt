Goto Nexus by clicking title link					DONE
+ Add Employee										DONE
(Check search employees only)						DONE
Search for emp and add								DONE


Adding to nexus or org chart – if they pull group down, those ppl will automatically be added
If an org is using the same org chart, they would import the group

Local – already added to portal   (facility only)
Nexus – they’re not   (section/depart wide)

Import (in portal)

When I hit cancel (in portal – group has to be open) the user from Nexus should be added 

If I were to add a backup, when you hit cancel (group is open) or sync services, backup should be added
            !! Backup should be added in any group

** Need to create a ‘test’ group to see if backup has been added in that group as well

To add/remove click name to goto nexus – assign a backup (assign backup on right menu)

THEN

Removing local and nexus (in portal) users  He should not appear on page and SHOULD be listed in inactive users
Someone who is a Nexus user will have a ‘reactive’ button, It should add them back to main list in portal

PERFORM FOR BOTH LOCAL & NEX
In inactive users  prune button which will remove them entirely

            Assert Inactive Users is not present

Click user
Remove backup and assert   [Remove] button
Sync Services
Shouldn’t matter if local or nexus


            Note: Cancel (in portal) it performs a sync services)

ToDO:
Delete Backups

the only thing I saw was maybe adding someone locally and deleting them so you can prune them.
[2:05 PM] Jamie Holcomb
you add two locally now but you add them to the nexus before trying to delete.
[2:06 PM] Jamie Holcomb
you could just add one to nexus and leave the other as local only.




Workaround
Import group
