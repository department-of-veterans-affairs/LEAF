My local CIO will confirm that the system meets VA configuration requirements prior to connection to VA’s network.</li>\r\n                <li>I will never swap or surrender VA hard drives or other storage devices to anyone other than an authorized OI&T employee at the time of system problems.</li>\r\n                <li>I will not disable or degrade software programs used by the VA that install security software updates to VA computer equipment, to computer equipment used to connect to VA information systems, or to create, store or use VA information.</li>\r\n                <li>I agree to allow examination by authorized OI&T personnel of any personal IT device [Other Equipment (OE)] that I have been granted permission to use, whether remotely or in any setting to access VA information or information systems or to create, store or use VA information.</li>\r\n                <li>I agree to have all equipment scanned by the appropriate facility IT Operations Service prior to connecting to the VA network if the equipment has not been connected to the VA network for a period of more than three weeks.</li>\r\n                <li>I will complete mandatory periodic security and privacy awareness training within designated timeframes, and complete any additional required training for the particular systems to which I require access.</li>\r\n                <li>I understand that if I must sign a non-VA entity’s Rules of Behavior to obtain access to information or information systems controlled by that non-VA entity, I still must comply with my responsibilities under the VA National Rules of Behavior when accessing or using VA information or information systems.  However, those Rules of Behavior apply to my access to or use of the non-VA entity’s information and information systems as a VA user.</li>\r\n                <li>I understand that remote access is allowed from other Federal government computers and systems to VA information systems, subject to the terms of VA and the host Federal agency’s policies.</li>\r\n                <li>I agree that I will directly connect to the VA network whenever possible.  If a direct connection to the VA network is not possible, then I will use VA-approved remote access software and services.  I must use VA-provided IT equipment for remote access when possible.  I may be permitted to use non–VA IT equipment [Other Equipment (OE)] only if a VA-CIO-approved waiver has been issued and the equipment is configured to follow all VA security policies and requirements.  I agree that VA OI&T officials may examine such devices, including an OE device operating under an approved waiver, at any time for proper configuration and unauthorized storage of VA sensitive information.</li>\r\n                <li>I agree that I will not have both a VA network connection and any kind of non-VA network connection (including a modem or phone line or wireless network card, etc.) physically connected to any computer at the same time unless the dual connection is explicitly authorized in writing by my local CIO.</li>\r\n                <li>I agree that I will not allow VA sensitive information to reside on non-VA systems or devices unless specifically designated and approved in advance by the appropriate VA official (supervisor), and a waiver has been issued by the VA’s CIO.  I agree that I will not access, transmit or store remotely any VA sensitive information that is not encrypted using VA approved encryption.</li>\r\n                <li>I will obtain my VA supervisor’s authorization, in writing, prior to transporting, transmitting, accessing, and using VA sensitive information outside of VA’s protected environment.</li>\r\n                <li>I will ensure that VA sensitive information, in any format, and devices, systems and/or software that contain such information or that I use to access VA sensitive information or information systems are adequately secured in remote locations, e.g., at home and during travel, and agree to periodic VA inspections of the devices, systems or software from which I conduct access from remote locations.  I agree that if I work from a remote location pursuant to an approved telework agreement with VA sensitive information that authorized OI&T personnel may periodically inspect the remote location for compliance with required security requirements.</li>\r\n                <li>I will protect sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction, including using encryption products approved and provided by the VA to protect sensitive data.</li>\r\n                <li>I will not store or transport any VA sensitive information on any portable storage media or device unless it is encrypted using VA approved encryption.</li>\r\n                <li>I will use VA-provided encryption to encrypt any e-mail, including attachments to the e-mail, that contains VA sensitive information before sending the e-mail.  I will not send any e-mail that contains VA sensitive information in an unencrypted form.  VA sensitive information includes personally identifiable information and protected health information.</li>\r\n                <li>I may be required to acknowledge or sign additional specific or unique rules of behavior in order to access or use specific VA systems.  I understand that those specific rules of behavior may include, but are not limited to, restrictions or prohibitions on limited personal use, special requirements for access or use of the data in that system, special requirements for the devices used to access that specific system, or special restrictions on interconnections between that system and other IT resources or systems.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>Acknowledgement and Acceptance\r\n            <ol type=\"a\">\r\n                <li>I acknowledge that I have received a copy of these Rules of Behavior.</li>\r\n                <li>I understand, accept and agree to comply with all terms and conditions of these Rules of Behavior.</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<input class=\"icheck_rob\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"rob_acceptance\" value=\"Accepted terms and rules of behavior\" style=\"width: 32px\" /> I understand and accept. <span id=\"rob_required\" style=\"margin-left: 8px; color: red\">*&nbsp; Required</span>\r\n</div>', `htmlPrint` = '<style>\r\n    #devconsole_description > p, #devconsole_description > ul > li {\r\n        font-size: 16px;\r\n    }\r\n</style>\r\n<div id=\"devconsole_description\">\r\n<p><b>This is a request to access the LEAF Developer Console.</b></p>\r\n<p>Approved individuals will gain the ability to modify LEAF\'s user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies.</p>\r\n<p>By approving this request:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>I validate that the person requesting access as the technical ability to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code.</li>\r\n    <li>I recognize that source code customizations and their maintenance are the responsibility of the office seeking to make customizations.
