# Code Reviews

* When reviewing, check out the feature branch associated with the pull request
* Ensure all unit tests pass
* Run through basic functionality of site (creating Forms, Workflows, requests, groups, assigning positions, etc..)
* Look for security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL Injection, etc..)
* Make sure new endpoints/methods placements make logical sense
* Ensure any new methods and endpoints have unit tests
* Ensure any new methods/endpoints have documentation
